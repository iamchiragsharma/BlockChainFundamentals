  <para><b>What is blockchain?</b></para>
  Itâ€™s a distributed database.
  Suppose we have a computer and anyone can access to it and can do some transitional activities. All transactions are stored in a
  block of data and these blocks are made in a way that makes them very hard manipulate once they are stored in a blockchain.
  Because of this, you can trust on these blocks.It can only be accessed by those you allow.
  It does not store large amounts of data for each transaction.
  You cannot store images on blockchain but you can store the information regarding the validation of image.
  Most data stored on a blockchain focuses on transactions and states of objects.
